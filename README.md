## Why AppWrite Instead of Firebase?

Initially started with Firebase but switched to AppWrite due to Firebase Storage being part of the Blaze (paid) plan. AppWrite provides a great free alternative with similar functionality.

## Features Implementation

### UI Components
- Shimmer loading effects

- Dynamic banner system
- Error state handling

### State Management
- GetX for state management
- Local storage for preferences

## Future Improvements

## Note
AppWrite credentials should typically be stored in environment variables, but for demo purposes, they're included in the project files.
